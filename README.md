## Project Version: 1.0.1

*For SES student project*: Trolley-Anti-Troll is an electronic differential system for pull-handle carriers (e.g., suitcases) to prevent rollover. It replaces mechanical structures with lightweight electronic control, using real-time wheel slip monitoring to enhance stability during turns. Low-cost, energy-efficient, and easy to deploy.

This project will be developed around and based on the UNIHIKER M10 Model flight control board as the hardware foundation.

## Project Features and Usage

Trolley-Anti-Troll is designed to prevent rollover in pull-handle carriers (e.g., suitcases) by implementing an electronic differential system. The system monitors wheel slip in real-time and adjusts wheel speeds during turns to maintain stability.
