# Troll-vs-Troll
*For SES student project*: Trolley-Anti-Troll is an electronic differential system for pull-handle carriers (e.g., suitcases) to prevent rollover. It replaces mechanical structures with lightweight electronic control, using real-time wheel slip monitoring to enhance stability during turns. Low-cost, energy-efficient, and easy to deploy.
